# Neural Network Charity Analysis

In this analysis, we are analyzing a csv file with over 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup. Creating a neural model network, we are attempting to determine and/or predict how sucessful future applicants can be. Alphabet Soup wants to utilize this data to vet which organizations they will donate to in the future to reduce the amount of funds misused. 

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
